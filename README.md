# Squares Controller

A local-first browser controller for Twinkly Squares. It keeps the stock
Twinkly firmware and coordinate map, so there is nothing to flash, open, or
solder.

## What it can do

- Paint, erase, fill, and preview the entire matrix in real time
- Import still images, animated GIFs, and video with fit, sampling, saturation,
  contrast, gamma, and playback controls
- Turn a browser microphone into Spectrum, Bass Halo, or 3-Band Field visuals
  with sensitivity, smoothing, and live frequency meters
- Mirror a screen, window, or browser tab through the same media sampling and
  color-correction pipeline
- Run sixteen procedural 2D and particle effects with speed, intensity, and
  optional effect-specific controls
- Select curated palettes, build two-to-eight-stop gradients, and save custom
  palettes to the controller library
- Compose two effect layers with opacity and five blend modes
- Target the whole wall, a panel, a row, a column, or a custom rectangle; pin
  up to three additional 2D segments with mirroring, transpose, grouping,
  spacing, and offset transforms
- Save server-persisted scenes and timed playlists with eight transitions,
  including cut, crossfade, push, dissolve, wipe, shift, radial, and pixelate
- Capture up to 32 hand-built pixel frames, set each frame's hold time down to
  25 ms, preview the loop, and bake it into controller movie storage
- See real scene thumbnails, exact browser-output previews, honest
  controller-local playback status, active-scene state, and playlist progress
- Organize scenes with folders, tags, favorites, search, filters, duplication,
  inline metadata editing, and merge-or-replace JSON backups
- Display scrolling text, a clock, and locally loaded fonts
- Schedule sleep, wake, brightness, stock-mode, and off actions
- Choose safe startup and stale-browser-frame behavior; unchanged startup and
  hold-last-frame remain the non-disruptive defaults
- Rotate the complete display to 0°, 90°, 180°, or 270°
- Control live brightness while custom frames are streaming
- Inspect advertised, measured, target, and delivered frame cadence plus relay
  gap, repeat, and missed-deadline telemetry
- Bake a finite effect, video clip, or static look into unused controller movie
  storage for browser-free playback without overwriting existing movies
- Integrate local tools through a versioned JSON API, OpenAPI document, CLI,
  Server-Sent Events, and a Home Assistant example
- Return to the original Twinkly animation at any time

The layout is read from the Twinkly controller at startup. This project has
been physically tested with a 4×3, 768-pixel Twinkly Squares wall: 32×24 at
0°/180° and 24×32 at 90°/270°.

## Quick start

Requires Python 3.11 or newer and Node 20 or newer. The frontend is strict
TypeScript compiled once by `npm run build`; the Python server then serves the
emitted JavaScript from disk with no Node process at runtime.

```bash
cp config.example.json config.json
```

Edit `config.json` and set the private IPv4 address of your Twinkly controller:

```json
{
  "deviceIp": "192.168.1.100"
}
```

Then build the frontend and start the app:

```bash
npm ci && npm start
```

`npm start` rebuilds the frontend and launches the server. After a build, the
server can also run on its own:

```bash
python3 server.py
```

While editing frontend code, `npm run watch` recompiles TypeScript on save;
`npm run watch:html` does the same for the markup partials (or run
`npm run build` once after markup edits).

On macOS, you can also double-click `scripts/start.command`.

Open [http://127.0.0.1:4312](http://127.0.0.1:4312). Press `Control-C` to stop;
a graceful shutdown returns the panel to its saved Twinkly animation.

Scenes, playlists, palettes, automations, and runtime policy are stored in
`.squares/` beside the controller. That directory and `config.json` are
ignored by Git.

## Docker and Unraid

The container builds the TypeScript frontend once, then runs the standard-library
Python server without Node.js or development dependencies. Images are published
for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` at:

```text
ghcr.io/mukw-labs/squares_controller
```

For a normal Unraid installation, bridge networking is sufficient because
Squares Controller uses only unicast traffic to a manually configured device
address:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name twinkly-squares \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 4312:4312 \
  -e TWINKLY_IP=192.168.1.100 \
  -v /mnt/user/appdata/twinkly-squares:/data \
  ghcr.io/mukw-labs/squares_controller:latest
```

Open `http://UNRAID_IP:4312`. The web UI has no authentication, so keep port
4312 on a trusted, firewalled LAN and do not expose it to the internet.

### Networking and Twinkly traffic

The application does not perform multicast or broadcast discovery. `TWINKLY_IP`
must contain the Squares controller's private or link-local IPv4 address. The
server contacts that address over HTTP and sends the realtime RGB protocol as
unicast UDP packets to destination port 7777. Port 7777 belongs to the Twinkly
device; it is outbound container traffic and must not be published on the
Squares Controller container.

If custom Unraid firewall, VLAN, or Docker routing rules prevent the container
from reaching the Twinkly device, host networking is a simple fallback. Do not
combine `--network host` with `-p`:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name twinkly-squares \
  --network host \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -e TWINKLY_IP=192.168.1.100 \
  -v /mnt/user/appdata/twinkly-squares:/data \
  ghcr.io/mukw-labs/squares_controller:latest
```

No UDP proxy, multicast relay, extra capability, or privileged mode is needed.

### Container configuration and storage

The image listens on TCP port 4312 and sets the required trusted-LAN opt-in.
Its relevant defaults are:

| Variable | Container default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `TWINKLY_IP` | unset | Required private/link-local IPv4 address of the Twinkly controller |
| `HOST` | `0.0.0.0` | Web server bind address |
| `PORT` | `4312` | Web server TCP port |
| `ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED_LAN` | `1` | Required acknowledgement for a non-loopback bind |
| `SQUARES_CONFIG` | `/data/config.json` | Optional JSON configuration file |
| `SQUARES_LIBRARY` | `/data/library.json` | Scenes, playlists, and palettes |
| `SQUARES_AUTOMATIONS` | `/data/automations.json` | Automation definitions |
| `SQUARES_RUNTIME_POLICY` | `/data/runtime.json` | Startup and frame-loss policy |
| `SQUARES_MOVIE_ARCHIVE` | `/data/movies` | Archived movie frames and metadata |

Map `/data` to persistent Unraid appdata as shown above. This is the only
required volume if `TWINKLY_IP` is set. As an alternative to that environment
variable, create `/mnt/user/appdata/twinkly-squares/config.json` containing:

```json
{
  "deviceIp": "192.168.1.100"
}
```

The process runs as non-root UID/GID `10001`. Ensure an existing appdata
directory is writable by that ID before starting the container. Docker-created
named volumes are initialized appropriately automatically.

Inspect startup and runtime output with:

```bash
docker logs --follow twinkly-squares
```

To update, pull the new image, remove the old container, and repeat the same
`docker run` command. Data remains in the mapped `/data` directory:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/mukw-labs/squares_controller:latest
docker stop twinkly-squares
docker rm twinkly-squares
```

### Sync this fork with upstream

This checkout keeps the fork as `origin` and the original project as
`upstream`. To incorporate upstream changes without rewriting its history:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main
```

## Local integrations

The versioned local API is documented in
[docs/INTEGRATIONS.md](docs/INTEGRATIONS.md). A few examples:

```bash
./scripts/squaresctl status
./scripts/squaresctl brightness 25
./scripts/squaresctl rotate 270
./scripts/squaresctl off
./scripts/squaresctl stock
```

The live OpenAPI document is served at
[http://127.0.0.1:4312/openapi.json](http://127.0.0.1:4312/openapi.json).

## Configuration

Environment variables override the defaults:

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `TWINKLY_IP` | Twinkly controller IPv4 address | `config.json` |
| `HOST` | Web server bind address | `127.0.0.1` |
| `PORT` | Web server port | `4312` |
| `SQUARES_CONFIG` | Alternate configuration file | `./config.json` |
| `SQUARES_LIBRARY` | Alternate scene/playlist file | `./.squares/library.json` |
| `SQUARES_AUTOMATIONS` | Alternate automation file | `./.squares/automations.json` |
| `SQUARES_RUNTIME_POLICY` | Alternate startup/frame-loss policy file | `./.squares/runtime.json` |
| `SQUARES_MOVIE_ARCHIVE` | Alternate movie archive directory | `./.squares/movies` |
| `ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED_LAN` | Explicitly allow a non-loopback bind | unset |

## Start automatically on macOS

From the project directory:

```bash
./scripts/install-macos-service.sh
```

This installs a user LaunchAgent, starts the controller at login, and keeps it
running after a crash. Remove it with:

```bash
./scripts/uninstall-macos-service.sh
```

## Security

The server has no authentication and therefore binds only to `127.0.0.1` by
default. A non-loopback bind is refused unless you make the risk explicit:

```bash
HOST=0.0.0.0 ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED_LAN=1 npm start
```

Use that only on a trusted, firewalled home network. Never port-forward port
4312 or expose it to the internet. The app also rejects public IP addresses as
panel targets. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Test

```bash
npm test
```

`npm test` builds the frontend (the strict `tsc` compile is the frontend
type gate) and runs the Python and browser suites against the compiled
output; CI additionally runs strict `mypy` over the backend and a coverage
gate. The suite covers HTTP
routes, device protocol behavior, coordinate mapping, brightness, rotation, state
synchronization, persistence, scheduling, API validation, palettes, zones,
blending, transitions, effects, audio analysis, live-input rendering, media
controls, scene organization, playlists, pixel clips, runtime failure policy,
relay telemetry, and safe movie payloads.

## Frame-rate notes

The connected controller advertises 40 FPS but reports a measured 38.46 FPS
clock. The browser produces frames just under the panel's sustainable rate
(1.5 FPS of headroom), and the relay forwards each fresh frame to the panel
the moment it arrives — one clock end to end, with idle keepalive repeats
only to hold realtime mode open. The UI reports fresh-frame cadence, delivery
gaps, repeats, and missed deadlines; those host measurements do not claim
that every frame lit physically. Controller-local movies use the
controller's integer 38 FPS playback path and remove browser, HTTP, Python
scheduling, and Wi-Fi cadence from ongoing playback.
See [docs/PERFORMANCE.md](docs/PERFORMANCE.md) for the measurements.

## How it works

The browser talks only to the local Python server. The server authenticates
directly with the Twinkly controller over HTTP and streams RGB frames over the
controller's local realtime protocol on UDP port 7777. The runtime uses the
Python standard library and native browser APIs; TypeScript is a build-time
dev dependency only, and every source file (backend, frontend, and markup
partials) stays under 500 lines.
